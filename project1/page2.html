<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Katawa Shoujo</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Katawa Shoujo was by far one of my favorite Eroge yet. Here's an synopsis:</p>
<body background="http://i60.tinypic.com/15xwwer.jpg">
<i>Katawa Shoujo is a bishoujo-style visual novel set in the fictional Yamaku High School for disabled children, located somewhere in modern Japan. Hisao Nakai, a normal boy living a normal life, has his life turned upside down when a congenital heart defect forces him to move to a new school after a long hospitalization. Despite his difficulties, Hisao is able to find friends—and perhaps love, if he plays his cards right. There are five main paths corresponding to the 5 main female characters, each path following the storyline pertaining to that character.-<a href="http://www.katawa-shoujo.com/index.php">Katawa-Shoujo Offical WebSite</a></i>
<p style="text-align: center;">What drew me to this title was well.... I asked about Galge on a Anime forum and the site's Admin told me about this one. I found this story to be a good one. I felt that it wasn't very complex but over all it turned out to be a great story. I complete the first story line in about four hours. It was a bit long but it has been a while since I played eroge/VN/Galge/what_ever_you_want_to_call_it. Last time I played on was about 5 years ago so needless to say it took abit to adjust. Over all I would play again.</p>
