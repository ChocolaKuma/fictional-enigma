<p style="text-align:center;">Ah Chobits. No matter how many times I <br>read this it never gets old. I've read every Different English <br>translation of this that is out there. Here is a short synopsis about <br>what this one is about it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Hideki's just like every other guy <br>in the 22nd century. He just wants a good job, a good car, and a <br>sexy robot girlfriend to call his own. Until he lands a job, he'll <br>never be able to afford his own 'Persocom' companion. Hideki's <br>luck changes when he discovers Chi--an adorable but seemingly stupid <br>Persocom--tied up in a pile of trash. His first robot companion <br>turns out to be a lot more responsibility than he expected, and <br>she gets him into quite a few embarrassing situations. It's <br>'boy-meets-girl' for the cyber age. (Tokyopop)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">So then lets get crack-en on with the <br>review. Over all I really enjoyed this one. like I've said earlier <br>I have read this just a few times (closer to 20 times). This was <br>my first Ecchi-Android-Romance manga/anime of all time. For those <br>who are wondering the manga is way better. Chi is probably the <br>reason why I went into computers in the first place. It was the Idea <br>of a computer like a <em>Persocom </em>that blew my mind. After <br>reading this I used a mix of programs to give my computer an AI <br>like system and got it to talk to me (god I'm forever alone <br>*insert face palm here*). This manga really touched me. The first time <br>I read it I cried at the end because of such a good ending. A side <br>note I made what sumomo says when she gets a call into a ringtone. <br>I love it.</p><br><br>
<p style="text-align:center;">Time for the score. Drum roll please</p>
