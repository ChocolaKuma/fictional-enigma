		SHUFFLE!
</h2>

This anime really moved me. Also I beleve that this masterpiece should be at the top of everyoneâ€™s anime queue. <br> This story revolves around rin and his relationships with five girls. <br> Before thus story takes place a magic door to bolth heaven and hell is found.  <br>Ever sence then angels, demons, an humans have been traveling to earth,heaven, and hell. <br>after the fist day of school ren finds out that has has been engaged to the daughter <br> of the king of angels and the daughter of the king of demons be this complcates thing with his current love intrest and child hood friend asa.  <br>Here is a better synopsis of the show from friends over at The Anime News Network.

<br> <br>
<i>
When two doors are discovered in an ancient ruin, the gateways to <br> shinkai, the realm of the shinzoku (Gods) and makai, the realm of the <br> mazoku (Demons) are irreversably opened. The races of human, <br> shinzoku, and mazoku come together in the mortal world and nothing <br> will ever be the same. One day, two new families move next door to a <br> boy who had previously been living a very peaceful life. In one <br> house lived the family of the King of the Gods, and in the other <br> lived the family of the King of the Demons. Both families had one <br> daughter  whose single wish to live next to the boy they had    <br>fallen in love with years ago has just been fulfilled. Also  <br>living  with the boy is his childhood friend. With these three girls   <br>vying for his affections, the boy finds that his new life filled  <br>with  despair, jealousy, and just a little hope is beginning. <br> </i>-<a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=5375">ANN</a> <br> <br>
