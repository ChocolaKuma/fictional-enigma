Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,<br>
 Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,<br>
 While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
 As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
 `'Tis some visitor,' I muttered, `tapping at my chamber door -<br>
 Only this, and nothing more.'<br>
<br>
<br>
<a id="2"></a>
 Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,<br>
 And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>
 Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow<br>
 From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore -<br>
 For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore -<br>
 Nameless here for evermore.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a id="3"></a>
 And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br>
 Thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br>
 So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br>
 `'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -<br>
 Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; -<br>
 This it is, and nothing more,'<br>
<br>
<br>
<a id="4"></a>
 Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br>
 `Sir,' said I, `or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br>
 But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br>
 And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br>
 That I scarce was sure I heard you' - here I opened wide the door; -<br>
 Darkness there, and nothing more.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a id="5"></a>
 Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br>
 Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br>
 But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,<br>
 And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, `Lenore!'<br>
 This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, `Lenore!'<br>
 Merely this and nothing more.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a id="back"></a>
 Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br>
 Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.<br>
 `Surely,' said I, `surely that is something at my window lattice;<br>
 Let me see then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore -<br>
 Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; -<br>
 'Tis the wind and nothing more!'<br>
<br>
<br>
<a id="6"></a>
 Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br>
 In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore.<br>
 Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br>
 But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door -<br>
 Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door -<br>
 Perched, and sat, and nothing more.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a id="7"></a>
 Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>
 By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br>
 `Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,' I said, `art sure no craven.<br>
 Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore -<br>
 Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!'<br>
 Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'<br>
<br>
<br>
<a id="8"></a>
 Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br>
 Though its answer little meaning - little relevancy bore;<br>
 For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br>
 Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door -<br>
 Bird or beast above the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br>
 With such name as `Nevermore.'<br>
<br>
<br>
<a id="9"></a>
 But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only,<br>
 That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br>
 Nothing further then he uttered - not a feather then he fluttered -<br>
 Till I scarcely more than muttered `Other friends have flown before -<br>
 On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.'<br>
 Then the bird said, `Nevermore.'<br>
<br>
<br>
<a id="10"></a>
 Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br>
 `Doubtless,' said I, `what it utters is its only stock and store,<br>
 Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster<br>
 Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore -<br>
 Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore<br>
 Of "Never-nevermore."'<br>
<br>
<br>
<a id="11"></a>
 But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,<br>
 Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;<br>
 Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br>
 Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore -<br>
 What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore<br>
 Meant in croaking `Nevermore.'<br>
<br>
<br>
<a id="12"></a>
 This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br>
 To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;<br>
 This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br>
 On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,<br>
 But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,<br>
She shall press, ah, nevermore!<br>
<br>
<br>
<a id="13"></a>
 Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br>
 Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br>
 `Wretch,' I cried, `thy God hath lent thee - by these angels he has sent thee<br>
 Respite - respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!<br>
 Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!'<br>
 Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'<br>
<br>
<br>
<a id="14"></a>
 `Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! -<br>
 Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br>
 Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted -<br>
 On this home by horror haunted - tell me truly, I implore -<br>
 Is there - is there balm in Gilead? - tell me - tell me, I implore!'<br>
 Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'<br>
<br>
<br>
<a id="15"></a>
 `Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil!<br>
 By that Heaven that bends above us - by that God we both adore -<br>
 Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br>
 It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore -<br>
 Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels name Lenore?'<br>
 Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'<br>
<br>
<br>
<a id="16"></a>
 `Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!' I shrieked upstarting -<br>
 `Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!<br>
 Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br>
 Leave my loneliness unbroken! - quit the bust above my door!<br>
 Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!'<br>
 Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'<br>
<br>
<br>
<a id="17"></a>
 And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br>
 On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br>
 And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,<br>
 And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br>
 And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br>
 Shall be lifted - nevermore!<br>
